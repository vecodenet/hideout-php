PHP SDK for Vecode Hideout

This is a slim library for interacting with a Vecode Hideout server, so you must have a working instance in order to use this library.

To get started you will need to configure the server and add a client so that you get a client token, please refer to its respective documentation if you need more details.

Also remember to always connect to Vecode Hideout instances using `https`.

### Installing

First require `vecode/hideout-php` with Composer.

### Basic usage

Now get an instance of `Hideout` with the `newInstance` method and set the server location and client token:

```php
use Hideout\Hideout;';

$server = 'https://hideout.my-server.com';
$token = 'xxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyy';

$hideout = Hideout::newInstance()
  ->setServer($server)
  ->setToken($token);
```

Once you have your `Hideout` object you may start interacting with the server.

### Generating keys

In addition to the client token, you will require a secret key (or several ones) to store and retrieve secrets on the server, so there's a handy endpoint for getting a valid key.

Is as simple as calling the `generate` method:

```php
use Hideout\Hideout;';

$server = 'https://hideout.my-server.com';
$token = 'xxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyy';

$hideout = Hideout::newInstance()
  ->setServer($server)
  ->setToken($token);

$key = $hideout->generate();
```

Once you got the key it must be saved in a safe place. For example you can set it as an environment variable so that you have it at hand later.

**Never store it in a public directory that can be accessed from the web.**

### Storing secrets

With your key you can create secrets, by using the `store` method and passing the `key` and secret `data`:

```php
use Hideout\Hideout;';

$server = 'https://hideout.my-server.com';
$token = 'xxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyy';
$key = getenv('my_secret_key');

$hideout = Hideout::newInstance()
  ->setServer($server)
  ->setToken($token);

$data = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Beatae atque officiis natus voluptatum debitis sunt.';
$entry = $hideout->store($key, $data); // $entry would be 'xxxxxyyyyzzz' for example
```

In this case you will receive the `entry` identifier of the secret once it is stored on the server. With this identifier you may retrieve it later.

### Retrieveing secrets

To get the secrets back just call the `retrieve` method, this time you must pass the `key` and the `entry` identifier:

```php
use Hideout\Hideout;';

$server = 'https://hideout.my-server.com';
$token = 'xxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyy';
$key = getenv('my_secret_key');

$hideout = Hideout::newInstance()
  ->setServer($server)
  ->setToken($token);

$entry = 'xxxxxyyyyzzz';
$data = $hideout->retrieve($key, $entry); // $data would be 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Beatae atque officiis natus voluptatum debitis sunt.'
```

Then you will receive the original data.

### Deleting secrets

There's also the option to delete any secret by calling the `delete` method with the `entry` identifier:

```php
use Hideout\Hideout;';

$server = 'https://hideout.my-server.com';
$token = 'xxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyy';

$hideout = Hideout::newInstance()
  ->setServer($server)
  ->setToken($token);

$entry = 'xxxxxyyyyzzz';
$hideout->delete($entry); // Just returns TRUE or FALSE
```

### Troubleshooting

The most common problem is with `https`. This library uses `biohzrdmx/curly-php` and it requires a properly configured server to work. Please [refer to its documentation](https://github.com/biohzrdmx/curly-php) to get more details.

Otherwise please open an issue and we will gladly help you.
